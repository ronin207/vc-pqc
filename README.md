### Setup
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd research-agent
cargo build --release
```

## Usage

### Basic Commands

#### 1. Scrape Papers
```bash
# Scrape 50 papers from 2020 onwards
./target/release/research-agent scrape --count 50 --year 2020

# Scrape with category filter
./target/release/research-agent scrape --count 100 --year 2022 --category "zero-knowledge"
```

#### 2. Build Knowledge Graphs
```bash
# Build graphs incrementally (only new papers)
./target/release/research-agent build-graph

# Rebuild all graphs from scratch
./target/release/research-agent build-graph --rebuild
```

#### 3. Query the Knowledge Graph
```bash
# Search for papers related to specific topics
./target/release/research-agent query "zero knowledge proofs" --limit 10
./target/release/research-agent query "post-quantum cryptography" --limit 5
./target/release/research-agent query "lattice-based" --limit 15
```

#### 4. Analyze Paper Connections
```bash
# Analyze connections for a specific paper
./target/release/research-agent analyze "2024/123" --depth 2
```

### Advanced Usage

#### Batch Processing
```bash
# Scrape papers in batches by year
for year in {2020..2024}; do
    ./target/release/research-agent scrape --count 50 --year $year
    ./target/release/research-agent build-graph
done
```

#### Domain-Specific Analysis
```bash
# Focus on post-quantum cryptography
./target/release/research-agent scrape --category "post-quantum" --count 200 --year 2020
./target/release/research-agent build-graph --rebuild
./target/release/research-agent query "CRYSTALS-Kyber" --limit 20
```
