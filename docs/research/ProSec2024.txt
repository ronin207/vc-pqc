Abstract. Digital credentials can streamline the verication process,
reduce fraud, and enhance the portability and accessibility of academic
records, and thus digital credentials become increasingly essential for
verifying academic achievements and qualications in a rapidly digitiz-
ing world. However, current research on digital credentials in the edu-
cation scenario falls into two categories: 1) blockchain-veriable creden-
tials, which either rely on blockchain security or classical cryptographic
problems and are not quantum-safe; and 2) post-quantum anonymous
credentials, primarily lattice-based, facing challenges in achieving condi-
tional linkability and e!cient revocation.
In this paper, we propose a generic framework for constructing an anony-
mous credential system named Blockchain-based Digital Education Cre-
dential ( BDEC ). Our framework requires only a digital signature scheme
and a zkSNARK. We formally prove the unforgeability, anonymity, and
unlinkability of the proposed framework and show that it additionally
supports conditional linkability and revocability. By instantiating the
framework with the post-quantum signature Loquat [Crypto24] and
zkSNARK Aurora [Eurocrypt19], we construct a post-quantum anony-
mous credential system whose security relies on collision-resistant hash
functions and the Legendre PRF. Furthermore, our resulting system of-
fers signicant improvements in its concrete performance over the lattice-
based system [Crypto23].

Traditionally, education certicates have served as the primary means to prove
an individuals educational achievements, skills, and employability in the job
market [ 23]. However, recent incidents have seriously challenged the credibility
of educational certicates. For example, a private university in India sold 36,000

fake degrees for $1,362 each, causing graduates in Singapore, Malaysia, the US,
and Canada to face pressure from employers worldwide to verify their qualica-
tions [ 22]. Additionally, 150 Indian students in Canada faced deportation after
being victims of an immigration scam that provided them with forged college
admission letters [ 15]. On the other hand, honest students holding authentic cer-
ticates are at risk of credential misuse and theft, as demonstrated by LinkedIns
2021 breach, which resulted in 700 million users proles being sold on the Dark
Web [ 27]. In addition, the rise of micro-credentials, dened by the European
Commission [ 9], as proofs of learning outcomes acquired through short learning
experiences, often results in fragmented learning records. This fragmentation not
only makes it di!cult to track continuous progress but also leads to repetitive
proofs of the same skills [ 10]. These issues underscore the urgent need for a more
credible digital credential scheme with the following desired properties, which is
the focus of our study:
Unforgeability: Ensures that credentials cannot be counterfeited.
Anonymity: Protects user privacy by preventing the linkage of credentials to
their identity.
Unlinkability: Guarantees user privacy one step further as di"erent shown
credentials cannot be linked to same identity.
Conditional Linkability: Supports selective linkability to address fragmented
learning records.
Revocation: Enables the ability to revoke credentials if they are compromised
or invalidated, ensuring that only legitimate credentials remain active.
1.1 Related Work
To address the above-mentioned issues, the most state-of-art approaches fall
into two categories: blockchain-veriable credentials and post-quantum anony-
mous credentials. These recent works build upon the foundational concept of
pseudonymous credentials, rst proposed by Chaum in 1984 [ 4], which enables
users to sign documents without revealing their identity. The Camenisch and
Lysyanskaya (CL) signature scheme [ 3]f u r t h e ra d v a n c e dt h i s e l db yp r o v i d i n g
af r a m e w o r kf o rc r e a t i n gs e c u r ea n de ! c i e n ta n o n y m o u sc r e d e n t i a l su s i n gg r o u p
signatures and zero-knowledge proofs. Until 2014, Garman et al. introduced de-
centralized anonymous credentials (DAC), leveraging the benets of distributed
technology to enhance privacy and security [ 11].
Blockchain-veriable credentials: In the recent blockchain domain, signif-
icant e"orts have been made to combat credential forgery and theft. Notably,
Damgard et al. introduced a credential identity layer that balances accountability
and privacy in blockchain systems to mitigate Anti Money Laundering issues
[7]. Other proposals have utilized Veriable Credentials (VC) and blockchain
Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) for various applications, such as electric vehicle
authentication [ 20]a n de d u c a t i o nc r e d e n t i a l s[ 16]. Traceability has also gained
BDEC: Enhancing Learning Credibility via Post-Quantum Digital Credential 3
considerable research attention in blockchain proposals. Zhuang et al. proposed
ap r i v a c y - p r e s e r v i n ga n dt r a c e a b i l i t ys c h e m ef o ri n t e l l e c t u a lp r o p e r t y[ 29], and
similar e"orts have been made for numerous supply chain management systems
[17,18]. Regarding conditional linkability, Coconut introduced the rst selective
disclosure attribute-based credential scheme supporting threshold issuance, al-
though it lacked support for traceability or revocation [ 26]. Shi et al. addressed
this limitation by incorporating threshold tracing and revocation properties [ 24].
In terms of updatability, Garman et al.[ 11]d i s c u s s e dt h ec r e a t i o no fu p d a t a b l e
(e.g., stateful) anonymous credentials, although their work did not fully im-
plement this feature. Despite these advancements, current approaches largely
rely on blockchain security or classical cryptographic problems (strong RSA or
Di!eHellman assumption) and are not quantum-safe. None of them can satisfy
all the desired security properties comprehensively.
Quantum-resistant Credential: Jeudy et al. [ 12]p r o p o s e dt h e r s tl a t t i c e -
based anonymous credentials system, leveraging the hardness of the Short Inte-
ger Solution (SIS) and Learning With Errors (LWE) problems. Their approach
marks a signicant step towards quantum-resistant credentials, but it currently
supports only a single message, making its use for anonymous veriable creden-
tials (VCs) cumbersome in terms of data size and performance. Other notable
quantum-based proposals include the work of Blazy et al. [ 2], who provided a
generic framework for constructing anonymous credential schemes, and Kazmi et
al. [13], who introduced a pseudonymous credential scheme specically designed
for use in payment systems. The only education-focused study is by Shrivas et al.
[25], who proposed a quantum-resistant university credentials verication system
using lattice-based cryptography and hash-based signatures within a consortium
blockchain. However, this study lacks comprehensive security proofs and code
implementation. Overall, the current quantum-resistant credential proposals are
primarily lattice-based, facing challenges in achieving conditional linkability and
e!cient revocation, thus highlighting the need for further research, possibly ex-
ploring symmetric-key primitives based schemes [ 8].

mous credential systems that also achieve conditional linkability and revo-
cability. Our framework assumes only black-box access to a digital signature
scheme and a zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive argument of knowl-
edge (zkSNARK) protocol, allowing for e!cient instantiation with post-
quantum building blocks. We provide a formal security analysis of the pro-
posed framework, proving its unforgeability, anonymity, and unlinkability.
Notably, if the underlying signature and zkSNARK schemes achieve perfect
zero-knowledge, which is commonly the case, our system achieves perfect
anonymity and unlinkability.

To demonstrate the practicality of our system, we analyze and compare the
sizes of key pairs, credentials, and credential proofs with those of existing
post-quantum anonymous credential systems. Assuming 128-bit security, our
instantiation with Loquat and Aurora results in public key, private key, cre-
dential size, and credential proof size reductions of 2,447, 86,752, 5.56, and
4.82 times, respectively, compared to the lattice-based anonymous credential
scheme proposed by Jeudy et al. [ 12].

Denition 1 (zkSNARK). A zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive argu-

ing algorithms (Sig.Setup ,Sig.KeyGen ,Sig.Sign ,Sig.Verify ):
1.Sig.ppSig.Setup (1). On input a security parameter in unary, the
algorithm generates a set of public parameters denoted as Sig.pp.
2.(sk, pk )Sig.KeyGen (Sig.pp): On input public parameters Sig.ppgener-
ated in the setup phase, the algorithm outputs a key pair (sk, pk ).
3.Sig.Sign (Sig.pp,s k,m ): On input public parameters Sig.pp,as e c r e t
keysk, and a message m, the (randomized) algorithm outputs a signature .
4.(0/1)Sig.Verify (Sig.pp, pk, m,  ): On input public parameters pp,a
public key pk, a message m, and a signature , the algorithm outputs 1
(accept) if the signature is valid. Otherwise, outputs 0 (reject).
Due to page limits, we refer readers to the standard security notions of zk-
SNARKs and digital signatures as detailed in [ 19]a n d[ 28], respectively.
2.3 Blockchain
Since its adoption in the Bitcoin cryptocurrency [ 21], the blockchain platform,
which is essentially a chain of blocks storing relevant digital data, has been
proposed to a wide range of applications. As a distributed ledger, the blockchain
enables the data to be stored on a number of nodes (or computers). Due to
the fact that the data can be accessed by anybody, it is challenging for any
single entity to fully control of the whole blockchain network. Such a distributed
feature of the blockchain, integrating with smart contracts [ 6], allows users to
deploy applications on the blockchain without the involvement of any trusted
authority.

credential, and the other one on attributes (Name: ABC, Company: Q Tech, Job:
Junior Software Engineer, Level: Internship, Duration: 3 months, Year: 2022).

Considering that a technology company Vposts a software engineer job and Bob
is willing to apply this job, in this scenario, Bob Uneeds to prove its capacity
to the company Vto become short listed. Bob Urstly generates a pseudonym
public and private key pair (ppk U,V,psk U,V)to communicate with the company
V, and then it extracts a shown credential cU,Von a statement that  (ppk U,V
has a bachelor degree and work experiences in Software Engineer from the XYZ
University and a proof cU,Vfor the ownership of the shown credential cU,V. The
company Vchecks the validity of the credential cU,V,a sw e l la st h ea s s o c i a t e d

in the blockchain, it is helpful for the student Uto avoid repeatedly proving the
ownership of the same attributes to various veriers. Take the previous scenario
as an example, Bob may need to apply several software engineer jobs posted by
di"erent companies. Bob may not want to repeatedly generating the ownership
proof cU,Vabout the shown credentials cU,Vproving the same statement about
his eligibility. In this case, Bob Ucan simply generate a proof linking the pre-
viously approved shown credential on the blockchain rather than a duplicate
proof on the shown credential.

3.3 Security Denitions
ABDEC scheme must meet three basic security requirements, including unforge-
ability, anonymity and unlinkability.
Unforgeability . This means that anybody, without knowing the private
user key of the student U,s h o u l dn o tb ea b l et of o r g eac r e d e n t i a l cU,T Aon

We dene the security game of Unforgeability for the BDEC scheme between
an adversary Aand a challenger Bas follows.
Setup. The algorithm Bgenerates the public parameter paras in the
Setup algorithm and sends partoA. In addition, Binitializes an empty
listLUstoring each user Us long term key pair (skU,p kU),p s e u d o n y m

Asends a user-key queries to the PriGen oracle on a user U. If there
exists a long term user key pair (skU,p kU)forUin the list LU,B
responds with the corresponding key pair. Otherwise, Bgenerates
(skU,p kU)by running the PriGen algorithm and adds the key pair
(skU,p kU)to the list LU.Bsends (skU,p kU)toA.
Asends a pseudonym key query to the NymKey oracle on a user U

tityTA,Bresponds with the pseudonym public key ppk U,T A.O t h e r -

We say that the BDEC system is unforgeable if the advantage function re-
ferring to the above security game

is negligible in the security parameter for any probabilistic polynomial-time
(PPT) adversary algorithm A.
Anonymity . This means that given any pseudonym public key ppk U,T Aand

Unlinkability. This considers the anonymity one step further, which means
that given any two pseudonym public keys ppk U,Vand their corresponding
credentials cU,V, anybody should not be able to tell whether they belong to
the same user Uor not.
We dene the unlinkability security game for BDEC between an adversary

ring to the above security game
AdvUNL
BDEC=|Pr[b=b]1/2|
is negligible in the security parameter for any probabilistic polynomial-time
(PPT) adversary algorithm A.
In addition to the aforementioned three properties, we require the BDEC
system to satisfy the conditional linkability and revocability.
Conditional linkability. This serves two primary purposes: solving the issue
of discontinuous learning records (fragmented learning) and avoiding repet-
itive verication of the same attributes. First, Students often accumulate
learning outcomes through various courses and platforms, leading to frag-
mented records. Conditional linkability allows students to link these frag-
mented records together, providing a continuous and coherent learning his-
tory. Second, students may need to present the same attributes to di"erent
veriers multiple times, requiring repeated generation of shown credentials
and proofs. To reduce this workload, the BDEC scheme should be armed
with a mechanism enabling students to reuse previous shown credentials
and proofs. Specically, conditional linkability in the BDEC scheme allows
students to link previous credentials and proofs to current ones, claiming
ownership of the same attributes without regenerating them, as long as these
BDEC: Enhancing Learning Credibility via Post-Quantum Digital Credential 11
credentials and proofs are included in the blockchain. If privacy is a concern,
students can opt not to link, as their credentials and proofs under various
pseudonyms on the blockchain do not reveal their real identities.
Revocability. In the BDEC scheme, students need to store their private user-
keys and pseudonym private keys in private. If any of those secrets is com-
promised, all associated (shown) credentials need to become inaccessible im-
mediately. To prevent any compromised credential from being continuously
utilised by malicious entities, it is of necessity for the BDEC scheme to achieve
Revocability such that students can disqualify their approved credentials if
they found that their private keys might be compromised.

based on decentralized anonymous credential schemes, and analyze its security.
4.1 A Generic Construction
Below, we describe a generic construction of our BDEC system based on digital
signature schemes and zkSNARKs. For denitions and further details of the
building blocks, we refer readers to Section 2.
parSetup (1).O ni n p u tas e c u r i t yp a r a m e t e r in unary, the algo-
rithm runs Sig.ppSig.Setup (1)and crs S(1), where Sdenotes
the setup algorithm of the underlying zkSNARK. The algorithm outputs
par=(Sig.pp,crs).N o t et h a tw ea s s u m et h es e c u r i t yp a r a m e t e r is an
implicit input to all later algorithms.
(skU,p kU)PriGen (par).O ni n p u tt h ep u b l i cp a r a m e t e r s par=(Sig.pp,
crs),t h ea l g o r i t h mr u n s (skU,p kU)Sig.KeyGen (Sig.pp)and outputs
(skU,p kU). Note that both the secret and public keys will remain hidden
unless the user decides to publish pkUthrough the RevCre algorithm.
(ppk U,T A,psk U,T A)NymKey (par,skU).O ni n p u tt h ep u b l i cp a r a m e t e r s
par=(Sig.pp,crs)and the users long term secret key skU,t h ea l g o r i t h m
randomly selects the pseudonym public key ppk U,T A${0,1}. The al-
gorithm computes the corresponding pseudonym secret key as psk U,T A
Sig.Sign (Sig.pp,s kU,p p k)(i.e., the pskis the signature generated by treat-
ingppkas a message and using skUas the signing key). Note that a user U
can have as many pseudonym public and secret key pairs as it expects. For
privacy concerns, the user Ucan use di"erent pseudonym public and private
key pairs to communicate with di"erent TAs.

the algorithm computes the credential cU,T ASig.Sign (Sig.pp,s kU,hU,T A).

Note that hU,T A=H(A)is the hash digest of all attributes, where the
denition of the collision-resistant His dened in Sig.pp.F i n a l l y ,t h ea l -

Sig.Verify (Sig.pp,p kU,hU,T A,cU,T A)=1 
Sig.Verify (Sig.pp,p kU,p p k U,T A,p s k U,T A)=1 .
In other words, the circuit to be proven by zkSNARK is dened as the AND
concatenation of two signature verication algorithms. The algorithm out-
puts (cU,T A,cU,TA). The user may submit (cU,T A,cU,TA,A,a u x ,p p k U,T A)
to the blockchain.

rst computes hU,T A=H(A). It then denes the NIZKPoK statement x=
(cU,T A,hU,T A,p p k U,T A)and invokes the zkSNARK verier V(crs,x , cU,TA).
The algorithm outputs 1 if and only if the zkSNARK verier algorithm V
outputs 1. Otherwise, outputs 0. The TA nodes should only accepts the
credential if and only if CreV er returns 1.

the verier: (ppk U,V,p p k U,V)NymKey (par,skU). The user generates the

Sig.Verify (pkU,p p k U,V,p s k U,V)=1
Sig.Verify (pkU,hU,V,cU,V)=1
The circuit proven by NIZKPoK is k+2 AND concatenation of signature
verication algorithm.
Considering the list of attributes Amay need to be repeatedly prove to
di"erent veriers. We would recommend rst uploading the tuple (cU,V,A,

for any future proofs on attributes Ato a distinct verier V,t h eu s e r Ucan
generate a proof

The circuit is an AND concatenation of two signature verication algorithms.
The user can simply append (

uploaded to blockchain.

4.2 Security Analysis
Theorem 1 (Unforgeability). The BDEC system is unforgeable under the as-
sumption that the underlying signature scheme is existentially unforgeable under
chosen-message attacks (EUF-CMA) and that the underlying zkSNARK proof
system is knowledge sound.
Proof sketch :A s s u m et h ea d v e r s a r yi sa b l et of o r g et h ec r e d e n t i a la n dc r e d e n -
tial proof (without users long term secret and public key), then it means the
adversary must either forge a valid signature or forge a valid zkSNARK proof.
14 Z. Li and X.Zhang et al.
Theorem 2 (Anonymity). The BDEC system is anonymous under the as-
sumption that both the underlying signature scheme and the zkSNARK are zero-
knowledge.
Proof Sketch :S i n c ep s e u d o n y mp u b l i ck e y sa r ej u s tr a n d o mb i ts t r i n g sc h o s e n
by the user, no one should be able to identify the read signer based on these
pseudonym public keys. Furthermore, since the signature and zkSNARK are
both zero-knowledge, the credential and the credential proof should not leak
any information about users real identity.
Theorem 3 (Unlinkability). The BDEC system is unlinkable under the as-
sumption that both the underlying signature scheme and the zkSNARK are zero-
knowledge.
Proof Sketch : The pseudonym public keys should not be linked to the same user
as they are random bit strings. Since the signature scheme is randomized and
the zkSNARK is zero-knowledge, the credential and the credential proof should
not be linked to the same user.
We show the formal security proofs of unforgeability, anonymity, and unlink-
ability in Appendix A.
Conditional Linkability. In the ShowCre algorithms, the user Uis able
to link any pseudonym public keys in the proof by showing that two pseudonym
keys are generated with the same long term secret key. Thus, for any previously
proven attributes (which have been accepted by the blockchain), the user Uhas
the capability to include them in the current credential shown process without
proving the ownership of those attributes for a second time.
Revocability. The RevCre algorithm supports the credential revocation.
Once the user Unds out that its private user key skUis lost or leaked, the user
Ucan publish the corresponding public user key pkUto the revocation list LR.
For any submitted credential cU,Vand the proof U,V, the verier nodes will run
the signature verication algorithm to check whether the submitted credential
cU,Vis a valid signature with respect to any public key pkUin the list LR.
We further discuss the approach to achieve hidden attributes from verier in
Appendix B.
4.3 Symmetric-Key Primitives Based Post-Quantum Instantiation
We describe the post-quantum instantiation of our BDEC system using the state-
of-the-art SNARK-friendly signature scheme Loquat [28]. The security of Lo-
quat relies solely on collision-resistant hash functions and the Legendre PRF,
making it post-quantum secure. The primary advantage of Loquat is its bal-
anced performance between signature size/speed and SNARK-friendliness. Since
our framework requires the user to prove signature validity during CreGen and
ShowCre ,i ti sc r u c i a lt h a tt h eu n d e r l y i n gs i g n a t u r es c h e m eh a sar e l a t i v e l y
small verication circuit. Although one-time signatures such as Lamport+ [ 14]
have better verication complexity, they are unsuitable for system instantiation
BDEC: Enhancing Learning Credibility via Post-Quantum Digital Credential 15
because the user needs a long-term key pair for signature generation. It is im-
practical for the user to maintain a state that ensures one-time secret keys are
never reused.
We instantiate the zkSNARK with Aurora [ 1]a n dF r a c t a l[ 5], which rely
solely on collision-resistant hash functions and features a transparent setup. Both
zkSNARKs has proof size polylogarithmic in the circuit size it proves, ensuring
small overhead for the credential proof generated in ShowCre , especially when
the number of TAs is large. Thus, the system is highly scalable. Furthermore, by
leveraging recursive proof generation of Fractal, the credential proof produced
byShowCre can maintain a size independent of the number of involved TAs.
5P e r f o r m a n c e E v a l u a t i o n
To provide a general idea of the performance of our proposed BDEC system, we
analyse two main metrics, namely credential size and running time for CreGen ,
CreV er ,ShowCre ,a n d ShowV er algorithms.
ForCreGen ,t h er u n n i n gt i m ei sm a i n l yd e p e n d i n go nt h es i g n i n gt i m ef o r
the signature and the time for generating the zkSNARK proof for the veri-
cation of two signatures. In this analysis, we take Loquat [ 28]a n dA u r o r a[ 1]
as concrete signature and zkSNARK schemes for our generic construction. The
signing time for Loquat signature is O(), where is the system security pa-
rameter. The proof generation time for Aurora is O(NlogN), where Nis the
number of gates in the circuit. Since Nis a polynomial of , this can be written
asO(poly() log ). Correspondingly, the running time for CreV er is mainly de-
pending on the verication time for the zkSNARK proof, and for Aurora it is
O(N),o rO(poly()).
Similarly, for showCre the running time is mainly depending on the signing
time for the signature and the time for generating the zkSNARK proof for the
verication of k+2 signatures. In this case, the signing time is O()and the
proof generation time is O(kpoly() log ), where is the system security
parameter and kis the number of TAs involved and in the worst case k=|A|.
Correspondingly, the running time for ShowV er is mainly depending on the
verication time for the zkSNARK proof, hence O(kpoly()).
For credential size, it is depending on the sizes of the signature and the zk-
SNARK proof. Table 2shows empirical data for the running times and credential
sizes with 100 bit security, for di"erent kvalues. We note that the performances
get less practical when the parameter kincreases to a relatively large value. How-
ever, this is due to the performances of the state-of-the-art zkSNARK schemes.
Given that our proposed construction is generic and modular, this can be im-
proved by switching the zkSNARK component to a future scheme with better
prover time, verier time and proof size.
Table 3compares the concrete performance of our scheme, instantiated with
Loquat and Aurora, to the previously proposed post-quantum anonymous cre-
dential system in [ 12]. To ensure a fair comparison, we use Loquat with 128-bit
security. For the credential proof size comparison, we assume both the number of

tant to note that in practice, the number of TAs is often greately smaller than
the number of attributes, and the credential proof size in our scheme depends
only on the number of TAs, not the number of attributes.

In this work, we propose a generic framework for an anonymous credential sys-
tem. The framework requires only two building blocks: a digital signature scheme
and a zkSNARK. We demonstrate that our framework satises unforgeabil-
ity, anonymity, and unlinkability with formal security proofs. Additionally, our
framework achieves conditional linkability and revocability, two features absent
in existing works.
By instantiating the framework with the post-quantum signature scheme Lo-
quat [28]a n dt h ep o s t - q u a n t u mz k S N A R Kn a m e dA u r o r a[ 1], we obtain a post-
quantum anonymous credential system whose security relies solely on collision-
resistant hash functions and the Legendre PRF. The concrete performance of
the resulting system is signicantly more practical than existing anonymous cre-
dential systems based on lattices [ 12].

As the proof is honestly generated, both psk

U,T Aare valid signatures,
the credential proof 
cU,TAis valid. Furthermore, due to the zkSNARK achieves
zero-knowledge, the proof hides pk

Note that if the underlying signature scheme and zkSNARK achieve perfect
zero-knowledge, then our system achieves perfect anonymous (i.e., the simulated
transcript is perfectly indistinguishable from the real transcript).

In our BDEC system, we assume users publishes the credential, credential proof,
along with all attributes to the public ledger (e.g., blockchain). Given that many
attributes cover general information without sensitive data, this is su!cient for
many applications. Nevertheless, there might exist scenarios where a user would
like to hide attributes shown to veriers in ShowV er phase. We recommend the
system to incorporate the Merkle tree accumulator to enforce such requirement.
To be specic, in the CreGen algorithm, instead of signing the hash digest of
all attributes, the user signs the Merkle root of the accumulated attributes (i.e.,
treating each attribute as a leaf of the tree). Then, the user only needs to publish
the Merkle root, credential, and credential proof on chain. The proof can still
be veried by TA if we assume TAs have full list of attributes of each user. If
the user wants to show a subsets of attributes to a verier, it can produces an
authentication path (a.k.a. the membership proof) for each attribute. Hence, the
verier can e"ectively verify whether provided attributes were approved by TA,
without knowing any additional attributes outside of the subset.
